    <ol> <li>The onCreate() function is the entry point to this Android app and calls other functions to build the user interface.</li>
        <li>The setContent() function within the onCreate() function is used to define your layout through composable functions. All functions marked with the @Composable annotation can be called from the setContent() function or from other Composable functions. </li>
        <li>You add the @Composable annotation before the function. <br>
            @Composable function names are capitalized. <br>
            @Composable functions can't return anything.</li>
            <li>The user interface (UI) of an app is what you see on the screen</li>
            <li> Almost everything you see on the screen of your app is a UI element (also known as a UI component)</li>
            <li>Jetpack Compose is a modern toolkit for building Android UIs.</li>
            <li>Composable functions are the basic building block of a UI in Compose. A composable function:

                Describes some part of your UI.
                Doesn't return anything.
                Takes some input and generates what's shown on the screen.</li></ol>
