        <li>The UI hierarchy is based on containment, meaning one component can contain one or more components, and the terms parent and child are sometimes used. The context here is that the parent UI elements contain children UI elements, which in turn can contain children UI elements. In this section, you will learn about Column, Row, and Box composables, which can act as parent UI elements.</li>
